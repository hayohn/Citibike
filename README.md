# Citibike Usage Analysis: Winter vs. Summer Months

## Overview
This repository contains Tableau visualizations analyzing the usage patterns of Citibike start stations in New York City during the winter (January) and summer (July) months from 2021 to 2023. The analysis aims to provide insights into the seasonal variations in ridership and identify the top stations for each season.

## Data Source
The analysis is based on Citibike trip data from January and July for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. The data was obtained from the Citibike system and processed to include relevant information such as start and end stations, ride duration, and bike types. https://citibikenyc.com/system-data 

Downloaded files were cleaned and combined in Jupyternotebook. the combined csv file is too large to upload in gitbhub.

## Key Findings
1. **Significant Seasonal Variations**: The analysis revealed substantial differences in the usage patterns of Citibike start stations between the winter and summer months. The number of trips tends to be higher during summer times, likely due to favorable weather conditions and increased leisure activities.

2. **Gradual Winter Increase**: While summer months consistently experienced higher ridership, there has been a slow but steady increase in the number of trips during the winter months over the years. This trend could be attributed to factors such as the expansion of bike infrastructure, improved bike lanes, and raised awareness about cycling as a mode of transportation.

3. **Cultural Shift towards Cycling**: The data suggests a gradual change in the perception and adoption of cycling as a viable means of transportation, even during the colder winter months. This cultural shift, along with the improvement of bike-friendly infrastructure, has contributed to the increasing ridership observed during the winter seasons.

4. **Top Summer Stations**: Stations located near popular tourist attractions, parks, or recreational areas saw a significant increase in ridership during the summer months.

5. **Top Winter Stations**: Stations situated in dense residential or commercial areas remained heavily utilized during the winter months, likely due to commuter traffic and local transportation needs.

6. **Weather Impact**: The analysis revealed that weather conditions played a crucial role in influencing ridership patterns.

7. **Commuter vs. Leisure Patterns**: The data suggested that the purpose of rides varied between seasons, with more leisure and recreational rides during the summer and a higher proportion of commuter rides during the winter.
